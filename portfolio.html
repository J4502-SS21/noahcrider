  <p class="text1"> Since I have a lot of passion for the topic, I created a website in html that explores LGBTQIA+ representation in games.There's a lot to learn and a lot to say about representation, so this was a fun topic to research and compile. </p>

  <p class="text1"> At the journalist-focused newsroom Global Journalist, I produced a series with a team on media accessibility in the modern age. I interviewed many from the accessibility community, including members of the deaf and hard of hearing community, to document their stories and learn about what could be done to better the accesibility of media. </p>

<h2> Vox Magazine | Multimedia Producer</h2>
