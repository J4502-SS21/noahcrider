<p class="text1"> Hi there. My name's Noah. I've been playing games since I was 6 years old, and I never really stopped. I've been a games journalism consumer since the beginning too. I remember flipping through GameInformer magazine with palpable excitement. Since those days, it doesn't seem like a lot has changed, while games have grown exponentially. I think we can tell better stories, include our audience more in what we do, and give a voice to videogame developers. I hope to make games media as fun to watch as games are to play. </p>
